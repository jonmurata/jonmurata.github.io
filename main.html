        <h1>A Little About Me</h1>

        <p>I am a senior at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in <font color="blue"><b>Mechanical Engineering</b></font> and <font color="gold"><b>Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science</b></font>. I was born and raised in Hawaii, but you probably couldn't tell given my surfing abilities or lack of pidgin. But hey, going home is a vacation every time! Check out the rest of my website to find out what I'm doing, aside from eating my body weight in spicy ahi and Zippy's, of course.</p>

            <p>I'll be honest. This kind of sucks right now. I promise you will love it... eventually...</p>
