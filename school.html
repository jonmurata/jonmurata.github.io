		<p>Bolded are some of my favorites so far, but my abosolute favorite is EECS 126: Probability and Random Processes.</p>

	    <h1>The 4</h1>
        
        	<p>Some of you may know that I've had a cumulative 4.0 for some time at Berkeley (5 semesters to be exact), but I am now rocking a solid 3.9. There were a lot of things that I learned through this journey, and you can read more about that story <a href="resources/the4.pdf">here</a></p>
