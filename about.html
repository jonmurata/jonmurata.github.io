        <closeHeadTop>About Me</closeHeadTop>
        <br>
        <p>Ah, so you'd like to know more? Here's everything interesting about me that I can think of at the moment. Don't get mad at me for all of this reading, you did this to yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <closeHeadTop>My Roots</closeHeadTop>
        <p>I was born and raised in Hawaii, and I couldn't imagine growing up anywhere else. I'm a 4th generation Japanese-American, and practically my entire family has been in Hawaii this whole time. My dad's side is from Maui, and my mom's side is mostly from Oahu. Sometimes I feel so distant and disconected as I spend a much larger fraction of my time in California, but theres a distinct feeling of home when I step off the plane into the humid air. PS: If you meet me in person, yes you can see the rainbow on my driver's license, yes I can kind of surf (I'm very bad), and no I have not seen lava up close.</p>
        <br>
        <closeHeadTop>School</closeHeadTop>
        <p>Yep, that's right. School is near the top of this list. I went to Punahou School from K-12. Sound Familiar? You may have heard of President Barrack Obama, who also attended this school. There are a lot of great stories, but my favorite is when I had to repeat Kindergarten to get in. No, it wasn't because of my poor studying habits, I just had a birthday past the cutoff. One extra year of naps and introductory reading for me! That actually sounds amazing to the college student me writing this now. Iâ€™ve spent more than half of my life at this school, and it was a real privilege to go here.</p>

        (There is a lot more of this. Winter is coming.)
